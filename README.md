To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd JobQuest
   ```

2. **Set up the API key:**

   - Create a `config.js` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following line, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
     ```js
     const config = { API_KEY: "your_api_key_here" };
     export default config;
     ```

3. **Start a local web server:**
   - You can use Pythonâ€™s built-in server:
     ```sh
     python3 -m http.server 8080
     ```
   - Then, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
     
## Deployment

### Web Servers (Web01 and Web02)

The application has been deployed to two web servers for redundancy:

1. Created directory `/var/www/html/jobquest` on both servers
2. Copied all application files to both servers
3. Set permissions to 755 for all files

### Load Balancer (Lb01)

Configured Nginx load balancer to distribute traffic between Web01 and Web02:

1. Created upstream server group including both web servers
2. Configured proxy pass to forward requests to appropriate server
3. Verified configuration using `nginx -t`
4. Restarted Nginx service
